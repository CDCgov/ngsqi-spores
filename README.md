## Introduction

**SPORES: Simulation, Phylogeny Estimation, Read Optimization, Resistance Mutation Identification and Evaluation, and Sequence Annotation** is a bioinformatics pipeline that performs quality control and preprocessing on empirical, long sequencing reads, incorporates variants of interest into reference genomes, and generates long-read _in silico_ datasets using empirically derived error models and genomes containing variants of interest.

[![Nextflow](https://img.shields.io/badge/nextflow%20DSL2-%E2%89%A522.10.6-23aa62.svg?labelColor=000000)](https://www.nextflow.io/)
[![run with docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/run%20with-docker-0db7ed?labelColor=000000&logo=docker)](https://www.docker.com/)

The primary objectives of the SPORES workflow entail:

* Generate long-read _in silico_ datasets based on genome sequences containing variants of interest and empirical long-read error models
* Perform preprocessing and error modeling on empirical long-read datasets
* Verify quality of empirical long reads and simulated _in silico_ datasets 

<!-- TODO nf-core:
   Complete this sentence with a 2-3 sentence summary of what types of data the pipeline ingests, a brief overview of the
   major pipeline sections and the types of output it produces. You're giving an overview to someone new
   to nf-core here, in 15-20 seconds. For an example, see https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/blob/master/README.md#introduction
-->

<!-- TODO nf-core: Include a figure that guides the user through the major workflow steps. Many nf-core
     workflows use the "tube map" design for that. See https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/design_guidelines#examples for examples.   -->
<!-- TODO nf-core: Fill in short bullet-pointed list of the default steps in the pipeline -->

This workflow is being built with [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html) and utilizes docker and singularity containers to modularize the workflow for optimal maintenance and reproducibility.

# Pipeline Summary
1. Input long-read sequencing data (.fastq) and reference genomes (.fna)
2. Perform quality control on sequencing reads using NanoPack tools (`NanoComp`,`NanoPlot`,`NanoQC`)
3. Preprocess empirical long-read data by filtering reads based on quality and length (`chopper`)
4. Prepare reference genomes for BWA alignment and variant calling (`NUCmer`,`bedtools`,`BWA`,`SAMtools`)
5. Modify reference genomes to contain variants of interest and simulate long sequencing reads (`SeqIO`,`NanoSim`)
6. Generate versions report

## Getting Started

Before running the pipeline, ensure Git LFS is installed and set up.

### 1. Install Git LFS
Run the following command to install Git LFS:
```sh
git lfs install
```
### 2. Clone the repository
Use:
```sh
git clone <repo-url>
```
### 3. Pull LFS tracked files
After cloning, run:
```sh
git lfs pull
```

## Usage

>**Note**
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

> To run the SPORES pipeline minimal test, you will need to add your user-specific credentials for the --ncbi_email and 
> --ncbi_api_key parameters to the profile script located at conf/test.config. 

> Once complete, you can run the minimal test
> with the following command:
> `nextflow run spores.nf -profile test,singularity --outdir <OUTDIR>`

### Set Up:

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input, empirical long-read data so that it resembles the following:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,fastq
Sample1, assets/data/B20592.fastq.gz
Sample2, assets/data/B21256.fastq.gz
```

Each row represents a long-read fastq file.

You will also need to prepare a samplesheet for reference genomes and variant annotations of interest to be used in simulation. 

`reference_samplesheet.csv`:
```csv
reference,clade,var_id,chrom,pos,var_seq
GCA_016772135.1,1,fks1_hs1,CP060340.1,221636,TACTTGACTTTGTCCTTGAGAGATCCT
GCF_003013715.1,2,fks1_hs1,NC_072812.1,2932580,AGGATCTCTCAAGgacaaagtcaagta
```
Each row corresponds to the following information:

- `reference`: Reference genome accession from NCBI

- `clade`: Clade number associated with _Candida auris_ reference genome

- `var_id`: Label for the given variant of interest

- `chrom`: Chromosome corresponding to variant of interest location

- `pos`: Numerical nucleotide position of variant of interest (use 0-based indexing)

- `var_seq`: Desired variant sequence of interest to be substituted in the given position

For instructions on creating an NCBI account and obtaining an API key, please visit the [National Library of Medicine Support Center](https://support.nlm.nih.gov/kbArticle/?pn=KA-05317).


<!-- TODO nf-core: update the following command to include all required parameters for a minimal example -->
### Running SPORES:
Now, you can run the pipeline using:

```bash
nextflow run main.nf \
   --input ont_read_samplesheet.csv \
   --fastas reference_samplesheet.csv \
   --ncbi_email <USER NCBI EMAIL> \
   --ncbi_api_key <API KEY> \
   --outdir <OUTDIR> \
   -profile singularity,cdc
```

>**Warning**
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files, including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option, can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
> see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#custom-configuration-files).
